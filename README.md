# Merge-files-in-a-folder
Helps merge all files in a folder into one file and add a column contains the filename

I've been doing an internship at Bytedance and need to moniter Spotiify's top playlists. This code helps me merge all the csv files into one with only one header. 
Also, the filename is the name of playlist, therefore, I need to add a new column to include this field. For the convenience of subsequent use, I've deleted the suffix .csv.
